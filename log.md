# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Last half of Dec 2017)
##### working on typing skills. Really should have taken that 7th grade class seriously. Thats ok im a fast learner and I've got the top row and middle row better mapped out. I even feel like Nikon off hackers everyonce in an while. ha! Defgonna keep up with awareness to the when find pecking and looking down come up.

**Disclaimer**: I will be using spanish here and there througout  my log and im sure in the printed side of my projects. Helps keep my mental state of flow. Chido. Empezemos.
 
### Day 1: Enero 1, 2018, Monday

**PROGRESS**: Forked and pulled 100daysofcode project via terminal.
Updated and set intention for log via vim all the while utilizing what I've learned in my last weeks of typing practice..

**THOUGHTS**: It was 9pm by the time i sat down to allocate at least 90min to my first day of code. If I'm being honest with myself, the first thing I need to address is that my intention to use my 5AM wake up to start was redirected to figure out my tax situation for 2017. I'm proud of this decision and my commitment to call it an early NYE and celebrate with EST y la familia in spirit. 

As freelancer and a father with a sick kiddo today; I see this 90min daily dedication succeeding best by aloting a time slot on the calendar.Especially considering that my first 30 days is trial to ingrain the routine and establish the systematic structure in my lifestyle to commit to a part-time code boot camp. I'm looking to pivot my career and fully formalize my knowledge of development by the end of 2018.This is exciting and equally challenging. That's a good sign because resistance in a journey brings real progress.

**TWEKS**:Vim is neat and I'm happy I got to learn a few more things about it like the SHIFT zz to save and close after exiting insert mode with ESC. Really though this linear structure for to navigate typing is not gonna fly for future logging.

Tomorrows 90min block to read the intro for javascript  has been set to start at2100 after the hopefully not too ill kiddos have gone to bed. 

I've also just turned off notifications for insta.

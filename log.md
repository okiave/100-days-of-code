:zap:**Disclaimer**:zap:: I'm using the above format and a mix of spanish/english throughout my log to support my mental state of flow. I use moon emojis to track my energy. All hours are in AKST (Alaska!!). Chido. Empezemos. 

**Day 1/100** of the **#100daysofcode** started on 1st day of 2018. I see this journey like the biketour my sister and I did in 2010. [Living nomadically ](http://avephoto.com/stories/#/south-of-here-1/) on a bikes forced us to log our progress and journal. What we discovered was that our endurance and stamina seemed to correlate with the phases of the moon. Over the years I began exploring how the relationship between lunar energy might work within a framework of mindfulness practices and cognitive behavioral tweaks. I'm a firm believer that the gravitational pull exerted on earth by the moon can be used as a leverage for productivity and restoration.

**TL;DR**: Tracking the moon helps me understand how to adapt to stress and challenges on a journey.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 24: Enero 2018, üåì

**__Progress__**: Today I completed the one page [tribute project on Alistair Cockburn](okiave.github.io/fcc-projects/tribute-page/).   

**__Reflections__**: 

**__Learned__**:

**__Tweaks__**:

### Day 19: Enero 19, üåí

**__Progress__**: I'm updating my log on my honest thoughts about whether trying to make the tribute page about content perfect and how that's setting me back.

**__Reflections__**: Another week has come to an end and I can honestly say I'm both proud of my progress and concerned. First off, I proud of the fact that I took the time to learn from reading documentation pages. That's not my favorite way to learn and it doesn't give me the same dopamine rush as searching and watching a video. I'm glad I can articulate that here because it will serve as a reminder that doing what's easy doesn't always make for growth or comprehension. Item two that's on my mind is I think my perfectionism is getting in the way of completing this first project which means that I'm holding myself back. The perfectionism doesn't have to do with the design but rather the nature of the content. I kinda want to make a page that clarifies what Agile is and isn't because I can tell it brings me more value that creating a timeline of Alistair's life. At the same though, I really want to move along and get on to the next project. The conclusion here is that what I'll do is make a simple bulleted list of what Agile is and is not. 

**__Learned__**:

1. Mixing learning styles
  
    I never realized how the thinking my preffered learning style of audio/visual could be a detrement to this code journey. After all, new libraries and frameworks are documented so required readinf is gonna be necessary.

2. Perfect is unatainable

    My journey to making the last part of the content page began stagnating because I lost sight of the basic user story. I wanted to get more in depth as way to understand how Agile and other methods for productivity work together. That's too much. I need to keep it simple, and I can always provide links to more in depth reading. 

**__Tweaks__**:

* Less youtube learning more documentaiton exploring

### Day 17: Enero 17, Wednesday üåö

**__Progress__**: Today was monunmental for me. I was able to correctly use bootstraps' gird and layout system. I know have a responsive tribute page with both paralax and the hero image I wanted.

**__Progress__**: Today was monunmental for me. I was able to correctly use bootstraps' gird and layout system. I now have a responsive tribute page with both paralax and the hero image I wanted. Now to finalize last third of content to satisfy the two user story requirements.

**__Reflections__**: Today I decided to code after a full day of focused work and visiting with my family from afar via facetime. That decision gave me the peace of mind to feel I had progress in my business and family life so I could focus on learning. I also did a mix of roller skate intermissions down at the warehouse through out my documentation reading. This helped me create condition of not roller skatig till i had understood a section. In the beginning this felt daunting because I kept right clicking on links to understand terminology and the context. I'm glad I did or today's result would not have been as rewarding. In the end it was about 45min of reading to 30min of cleaning up code with about five sessions of sakting totaling 20mins.  
**__Learned__**:

1. Undoing with git reset 

    Took the time to read and understand the various methods to [undo in git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes)

2. Flexbox is my friend
    
    No more positioning elements with inline css like I used to. I've come to understand boostrap's power by with a little reading [felxbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background)

**__Tweaks__**: 

1. Clean up house in AM so I can study and cook in PM.

### Day 16: Enero 16, Tuesday :new_moon_with_face:

**__Progress__**: Cleaned up indentation and content for [Alistair Cockburn](https://github.com/okiave/100-days-of-code/blob/master/projects/paralax/index.html).

**__Reflections__**: Over the last two days I've finally begun to see the level of progress that reflects what I've learned from FCC in the first 100 sessions. Mainly the various  bootstrap classes that are available. I can tell that learning to position elements before bootstrap has me tending to want to fix things with inline style tweaks. My goal is to avoid this and understand how to translate my vision into bootstrap speak for layout, grid and positioning. With responsiveness being key these days there's really no point if it just works for one screen size. Also I'm noticing updating this log daily is the hardest aspect of my current #100daysofcode journey.

**__Learned__**: 

1. bootstrap `class="row align-middle justify-content-center"`

    In my quest to resolve why some of my div elements were'nt cooperating, I came across the concept of [vertical](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#vertical-alignment) and [horizontal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#horizontal-alignment) alignment layout using bootstrap.  
    
**__Tweaks__**:

* Spend more time using search feature within boostrap documentation 

* Let's start to audio capture what I'm learning as I go so i can update log as I go with memory throughout the 90min session.

### Day 12: Enero 12, Tuesday üåò  

**__Progress__**: Started hand coding the main parts of a parallax tribute page for [Alistair Cockburn](https://github.com/okiave/100-days-of-code/blob/master/projects/paralax/index.html).

**__Reflections__**: This is not easy. I feel like my current skill level and sense of aesthetic have a massive gap. I'm proud that I'm choosing not to copy/past this tribute page from another template. I really do want to understand how the bootstrap build upon each other. I've also gotta figure out my game plan for weekly goals on this #100daysofcodejourey. I can't run a household and make this my full-time because who else is gonna bring in the revenue for next month? Freelancing dadlife sucks but its the reality I'm embracing. My disappointment with how little progress I've made this week has to do with forgetting I can be over the top with ambition and drive. 

**__Learned__**: 

1. bootstrap dependecies

    After researching a number of approaches to parallax, I've settled on working with the core [codebase of bootstrap](https://github.com/okiave/bootstrap) and have since cloned it to my local machine for future use. As small as this sounds I can't explain how much more efficient is to now just pull new updates for the framework.  
    
2. addressing all users of parallax

	As I explored the web for various projects in parallax it was cool to fine [this one](http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/) that was comprehensive and documented with info on how to address devices that won't render the effect.      
    
    
**__Tweaks__**:

* Must get more than 5 hours of sleep. I feel drunk running on anything less than that.

* Generating leads for revenue must be a priority.

* Simple yummy meal planning for next week.

---

### Day 11: Enero 11, üåò

**__Progress__**: Fleshed out the tribute page with content.

**__Reflections__**: Not much to speak of that felt like true progress. More like throwing spaghetti at the wall with random inline CSS tweaks. I really need to gtk bootstrap better.

**__Learned__**:

1. The practice of Design Thinking
  
  When I decided to make a tribute page on Alistair I did so bc I saw that Agile as a process also related to [design thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXrheqhTCs&index=1&t=15s&list=PLmayTjecwZXO8lt_sr4FRUu-n0BzD_y9C). This is the kinda info that makes my day because I feel I live in world of institutional thinking and I'm starved for more connection to others who think adaptivley and collabortively.

---

### Day 9: Enero 9, üåó

**__Progress__**: After completing the last three challenges of JQuery I'm starting my [first project](https://github.com/okiave/100-days-of-code/blob/master/projects/tribute-page.html) which is to build a tribute page using codepen on Alistair Cockburn.

**__Reflections__**: The prompt for the project used the term "*user stories*" that linked to wiki entry that referenced a man by the name of Alistair Cockburn who created Agile model for developing software. This immediately was my sign from the universe to make the tribute page about him because now I get to research the methodology and its origins. I'm also interested to better understand user stories. My decision to pivot toward dev skills is that I've found the life of a photographer too isolating when it comes to most projects. I really enjoy working on teams and see code as the context to get deeper into that world.

**__Learned__**: 

1. CSS Borders please

    This isn't new to me, however it was the first time I used it to understand makeup of a page with regards to visible elements and none visible elements. That in turn makes me see how laying out the initial [blocks stack up](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4628/38703743245_46f5d7fb1d_b.jpg) with CSS in place.
    

2. Data in Javascript

	One of the CS concepts I'm still wrapping my head around is how data is stored and passed on down the line. IDK how i found this but this [screencast video](https://scrimba.com/p/pRB9Hw/cN9EWSw) of a dad explaining to his son gave me a greater vocabulary. Now I know that arrays can be objects and be called in and that the values of labels can also be used.
When the dad was teaching his son about POJOs (Plain 'ol javascript object) also reminded me of pollo :chicken: and pollito :baby_chick:.
**__Tweaks__**:

* Gonna give these logs their due diligence so i can practice regurgitating more of what i learned.


---

### Day 8: Enero 8, Monday üåó

**__Progress__**: Challenges 94-107 on Freecodecamp today were all about using CSS selectors to modify and remove html elements. JQuery can select elements in similar ways as CSS, it also has the ability control elements through parental or child positions.

**__Reflections__**: Early morning are absolutely the zone for me to learn. My mind is crisp and by reading out loud I grasp what's happening. I've noticed I can have a tendency to miss small details like capital letters mid selection or function which greatly affect the result. Also moving to standing desk for seshes keeps me way more attentive to how my body feels and that in turn proves to keep me more alert for learning.

**__Learned__**: 

1. `$("document").ready(function()) {} );`

    The $ at the start of the statement can be read as bling. Additional statements are put between the curly brackets {} and end with a semi-colon. Its also possible to combine multiple selectors together.
    

**__Tweaks__**:

* Gonna give these logs their due diligence so i can practice regurgitating more of what i learned.


---

### Day 7: Enero 7, Sunday üåó

**__Progress__**: Completed challenges 81-93 on Freecodecamp, got super into Bootstrap and am now officially entered JQuery waters.

**__Reflections__**: A lot of what astonishes me about the web is how much seems to get abstracted. To think that I will first be learning JQuery before js makes me consider whether this will hinder my future ability. I tend to lean on the side of knowing the origin of things in order to make sense of the present. Clearly I'm free to educate myself deeper than the challenges from FCC. Also got a new local buddy joining me on the FCC 


**__Learned__**: 

1. Bootstrap

    Is a CSS a framework that takes the math out of designing a responsive grid bc of it's built in classes. It uses a 12-column wide design that can be divided by thirds, quarters, halves. It's also got a ton of basic classes for making various elements pretty and gives you the ability to use font awesome easily. Now I'm curious to play with it on Kirbycms.
    

**__Tweaks__**:

* Moving to standing desk for code. I can feel my posture caving.  


---


### Day 6: Enero 6, Saturday üåñ 

**__Progress__**: Completed challenges 25-80 on Freecodecamp on HTML and Bootstrap. 

**__Reflections__**: Some how I managed to skip to the Mongodb tutorial before I had even got into the JQuery challenges. I think this happened that day I did my 90min of code between errands in the car on an ipad while my sick Rio napped. In other news bootstrap is amazing! Back when I was self-learning css there was no such thing as responsive design and a lot of the pretty fancy things had to be done with background image placements and detailed grid positions. So glad that framework came to be.

**__Tweaks__**:

* Must clean up computer. Performance is too laggy.

### Day 5: Enero 5, Friday üåñ 

**__Progress__**: Tweaked my github pages repo. 

**__Reflections__**: A week of with little exercise and major project management make for barriers to learning. The experiment to learn under stress is only manageable if I have a method for expressing the pent up energy. Looks like swimming, running, and roller skating are back in. My body needs that anaerobic hit of goodness at least three times a week.


**__Learned__**: 

1. Meltown/Spectre

    My recent learnings on arrays and their use of memory blocks brought enough insight that I could follow a rough understanding about how the current architecture/operations of modern CPUs can be used to access memory stored on CPU. 
    

**__Tweaks__**:

* More exercise, less coping behaviors  

* Continue with learnyoumongodb on cloud9.

---


### Day 4: Enero 4, Thursday üåñ 

**__Progress__**: Created my github pages repo for publishing better updates. Learned about DOM, JSON structure and jQuery.

**__Reflections__**: Woke up feeling sick. It seems I picked up the stomach bug kiddos had. I plowed through my business todos and was ready to start learning by 830AM. My brain  is definitely better equipped to learn in the AM. Also found my coding glasses.


**__Learned__**: 

1. DOM

    The document object model is the element structure of an HTML document that breaks down the parent and children relationships to the elements within the html page. The neat thing about the console in the browser and DOM is you can interact with specific elements on the page using javascript. In this manner, it behaves like an api by receiving requests from console commands and returns results.
    
    
2. jQuery & Javascript
 
   My git repo got out of sync and I found this youtube vid that explained the mechanics of what goes on when repos are out of sync.
 * [Yourtube playlist to JS and jquery ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmayTjecwZXNigR19fK6xt51y8VBn-6Cw)
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Continue to learn about computer science aspects of arrays, conditionals, and events.

* Continue with learnyoumongodb on cloud9.

* learn how jekyll works to publish log there.

---



### Day 3: Enero 3, Wednesday üåù

**__Progress__**: Mongodb running in AWS cloud9 and Git repo back in sync 

**__Reflections__**: Last night's late tweet on needing help bc he FCC tutorial no longer reflected changes made by AWS buyout was key. A long time twitter amigo [@knapkjack](https://twitter.com/knapjack/status/948572871156154368) found a git repo with directions to get rolling.  The video i watched last night while xcode downloaded gave me enough of a frame work that the the first two challenges of installing and verifying mongodb. Now that I've completed the first two exercises of leanrmymongo I can tell the new wall has to do with understanding the js syntax.


**__Learned__**: 

1. AWS/c9

    How to create a user for the IDE environment on c9 through AWS and install mongodb. Starting and stopping it as a service made sense bc I already new MYSQL and Apache also operated as services on a server. Also got to make a file in vim from scratch and how to name and save it.

* [Getting started with cloud9 on Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/nax3t/aws-cloud9-instructions/blob/master/README.md)    
* [Tutorial on Vim commands](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial)    
    
2. Git
 
   My git repo got out of sync and I found this youtube vid that explained the mechanics of what goes on when repos are out of sync.
 * [Merging remote changes explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6pxsaXAhbI)
       
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Define programing terminology: array and conditional statements

* Source a tutorial for understanding JS syntax

* clean up house to find my welding glasses for late night screen sessions.
---


### Day 2: Enero 2, Tuesday üåù

**__Progress__**: Plowed through the freecodecamp.org (FCC) html/css challenges. Could not figure out how to install mongodb on AWS cloud9 so I jumped into local machine and am setting it up through brew.

**__Reflections__**: Ok so today, my son Rio was sick. Yesterday it was my daughter. NTL when he napped in the car I took the time to  review css/html challenges of FCC. This was fun bc the dopamine high i was on of knowing how to navigate those basics. Now that I'm at the node.js challenge the first hurdle will be getting a local version of learnmymongodb up and running. I may also just opt to do a docker image with all the goodies.

**__Learned__**: 

1. CSS - Multiple classes per element 

    This surprised me bc I thought I new CSS pretty well. Idk if this change was adopted from when I started learning CSS a decade ago. All you need is a blank space between multiple class names. Very cool.
    
2. AWS/cloud9/Brew
 
   I'm quasi familiar with AWS. Mostly the bucket aspect of AWS for years as additional remote storage for media. Today though I got to deploy my first instance and it was simple enough except for that I'm not familiar with how to navigate Amazon's flavor of Linux. It seems they use yum as package manager. I switched over to Brew locally and it turns out macOS High Sierra did away with the necessary dependencies in order to run mongodb so I'm now patiently waiting for all of xcode to install.
       
3. Mongodb - 

   Having troubleshooted some aspects of Wordpress, I was already familiar with the how a relational database organizes its contents. Watching a tutorial on mongodb blew my mind bc it connected the dots for how an app could scale dynamically based on demand. It was cool to see I could make sense of the JSON formatting thanks to my adventures in #maptime geoJSON data.
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Continue trouble shooting Xcode and MongoDb tomorrow in order to complete learnmymongodb challenge.

* Define programing terminology: array and conditional statements

* Finish Xcode and MongoDb install tomorrow.

* bring git repo back into sync with local.

* clean up house to find my welding glasses for these late night screen sessions.

### Day 1: Enero 1, Monday üåù

**__Progress__**: Forked and pulled 100daysofcode project via terminal.
Updated and set intention for log via vim all the while utilizing what I've learned in my last weeks of typing practice..

**__Reflections__**: As freelancer and a father with a sick kiddo today; I see this 90min daily dedication succeeding best by allotting a time slot on the calendar.Especially considering that my first 30 days is trial to ingrain the routine and establish the systematic structure in my lifestyle to commit to a part-time code boot camp. I'm looking to pivot my career and fully formalize my knowledge of development by the end of 2018.This is exciting and equally challenging. That's a good sign because resistance in a journey brings real progress.

**__Learned__**: 

1. Vim 

    Is neat and I'm happy I got to learn a few more things about it like the SHIFT zz to save and close after exiting insert mode with ESC. Really though linear structure for to navigate typing is not gonna fly for future logging. Time for Coda.

2. Git/Terminal
 
   rm deletes file and rmdir deletes directory. If needing to remove directory with contents must use recursive flag -r. Re-learned that one must "git add" the file one intends to push before push.   
   
     
3. Markdown - Must look pretty

   After pushing my first commit i found the format of log needing love with some indentation and lists.  
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Tomorrow's 90min block to read the intro for javascript has been set to start at2100 after the hopefully not too ill kiddos have gone to bed. 

* I've also just turned off notifications for insta and will leave phone across room to charge while in session with this.

* Gonna implement 30 sec of belly breathing when i feel my brain tipping toward ADHD. Prolly have to do some jumping jacks here and there too.

---

### Day 0: Last half of Dec 2017
**__Reflections__**: Working on typing skills. Really should have taken that 7th grade class seriously. Thats ok im a fast learner and I've got the top row and middle row better mapped out. I even feel like Nikon from hackers every once in an while. ha! Def gonna keep up with awareness to the when find pecking and looking down come up.

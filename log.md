# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Last half of Dec 2017
Working on typing skills. Really should have taken that 7th grade class seriously. Thats ok im a fast learner and I've got the top row and middle row better mapped out. I even feel like Nikon off hackers every once in an while. ha! Def gonna keep up with awareness to the when find pecking and looking down come up.

**Disclaimer**: I will be using spanish here and there throughout  my log and im sure in the printed side of my projects. Helps keep my mental state of flow. Chido. Empezemos. Day 1 of 100days starts on 1st day of 2018. All hours are in AKST (Alaska!!)
 
### Day 1: Enero 1, Monday

**__Progress__**: Forked and pulled 100daysofcode project via terminal.
Updated and set intention for log via vim all the while utilizing what I've learned in my last weeks of typing practice..

**__Reflections__**: As freelancer and a father with a sick kiddo today; I see this 90min daily dedication succeeding best by allotting a time slot on the calendar.Especially considering that my first 30 days is trial to ingrain the routine and establish the systematic structure in my lifestyle to commit to a part-time code boot camp. I'm looking to pivot my career and fully formalize my knowledge of development by the end of 2018.This is exciting and equally challenging. That's a good sign because resistance in a journey brings real progress.

**__Learned__**: 

1. Vim 
...Is neat and I'm happy I got to learn a few more things about it like the SHIFT zz to save and close after exiting insert mode with ESC. Really though linear structure for to navigate typing is not gonna fly for future logging. Time for Coda.

2. Git/Terminal 
... rm deletes file and rmdir deletes directory. If needing to remove directory with contents must use recursive flag -r.

3. Markdown - Must look pretty
... After pushing my first commit i found the format of log needing love with some indentation and lists.

**__Tweaks__**:
* Tomorrow's 90min block to read the intro for javascript has been set to start at2100 after the hopefully not too ill kiddos have gone to bed. 

* I've also just turned off notifications for insta and will leave phone across room to charge while in session with this.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Last half of Dec 2017
**__Reflections__**: Working on typing skills. Really should have taken that 7th grade class seriously. Thats ok im a fast learner and I've got the top row and middle row better mapped out. I even feel like Nikon from hackers every once in an while. ha! Def gonna keep up with awareness to the when find pecking and looking down come up.

**Disclaimer**: I will be using spanish here and there throughout  my log and im sure in the printed side of my projects. Helps keep my mental state of flow. Chido. Empezemos. Day 1 of 100days starts on 1st day of 2018. All hours are in AKST (Alaska!!)
 
### Day 1: Enero 1, Monday

**__Progress__**: Forked and pulled 100daysofcode project via terminal.
Updated and set intention for log via vim all the while utilizing what I've learned in my last weeks of typing practice..

**__Reflections__**: As freelancer and a father with a sick kiddo today; I see this 90min daily dedication succeeding best by allotting a time slot on the calendar.Especially considering that my first 30 days is trial to ingrain the routine and establish the systematic structure in my lifestyle to commit to a part-time code boot camp. I'm looking to pivot my career and fully formalize my knowledge of development by the end of 2018.This is exciting and equally challenging. That's a good sign because resistance in a journey brings real progress.

**__Learned__**: 

1. Vim 

    Is neat and I'm happy I got to learn a few more things about it like the SHIFT zz to save and close after exiting insert mode with ESC. Really though linear structure for to navigate typing is not gonna fly for future logging. Time for Coda.

2. Git/Terminal
 
   rm deletes file and rmdir deletes directory. If needing to remove directory with contents must use recursive flag -r. Re-learned that one must "git add" the file one intends to push before push.   
   
     
3. Markdown - Must look pretty

   After pushing my first commit i found the format of log needing love with some indentation and lists.  
   

**__Tweaks__**:

* Tomorrow's 90min block to read the intro for javascript has been set to start at2100 after the hopefully not too ill kiddos have gone to bed. 

* I've also just turned off notifications for insta and will leave phone across room to charge while in session with this.

* Gonna implement 30 sec of belly breathing when i feel my brain tipping toward ADHD. Prolly have to do some jumping jacks here and there too.

### Day 2: Enero 2, Tuesday

**__Progress__**: Plowed through the freecodecamp.org (FCC) html/css challenges. Could not figure out how to install mongodb on AWS cloud9 so I jumped into local machine and am setting it up through brew.

**__Reflections__**: Ok so today, my son Rio was sick. Yesterday it was my daughter. None the less when he napped in the car I took the time to get the review css/html challenges of FCC. This was fun bc the dopamine high i was on of knowing how to navigate those basics. Now that I'm at the node.js part of the challenge the first hurdle will be trouble shooting the local version of learning mongodb interacts with js.

**__Learned__**: 

1. CSS - Multiple classes per element 

    This surprised me bc I thought I new CSS pretty well. Idk if this change was adopted from when I started learning CSS a decade ago. All you need is a blank space between multiple class names. Very cool.
    
2. AWS/cloud9/Brew
 
   I'm quasi familiar with AWS. Been using mostly the bucket aspect of AWS for years as remote storage as backup for media. Today though I got to deploy my first instance and it was simple enough except for that I'm not familiar with how to trouble shoot Amazon's flavor of Linux. It seems they use yum as package manager. I switched over to Brew locally and it turns out macOS High Sierra did away with the necessary dependencies in order to run mongodb so I'm now patiently waiting for it to finish.
       
3. Mongodb - 

   Having troubleshooted some aspects of Wordpress, I was already familiar with the how a relational database organizes its contents. Watching this tutorial on mongodb blew my mind bc it connected the dots for me on how a app could scale dynamically based on demand. It was neat to see I could make sense of the JSON formatting thanks to my adventures in #maptime geoJSON data.
   

**__Tweaks__**:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Continue trouble shooting Xcode and MongoDb tomorrow in order to complete learnmymongodb challenge.

* Define programing terminology: array and conditional statements

* Must pickup house to find rose colored welding glasses for these late night screen sessions.
